=== Synopsis

This is the main project, Rudder, the web console that allows
to see nodes inventory, manage group of nodes, apply configuration
rules derived from techniques.

This project is composed of several modules:

[horizontal]
rudder-core:: that module contains most of the logic for Rudder (i.e most of the
         business tier). Among other things, you will find:
  * all the logic to save and bind parameters to techniques;
  * the pipeline of action that generates CFEngine promises from templates, parameters
    and group of nodes;
  * an LDAP query processor that allows "join" like operations;
  * historization of user logging action.
         
rudder-web:: that module contains all the presentation layer and the service weaving
         logic. Along with all the web standard things (JS, CSS, etc) you will find
         some unusual Liftweb integration:
  * utilities to use Spring in a Lift application
  * a plugin system for Lift
  * a somehow unusual organisation of Lift snippets in components belonging to pages
  * an automatic web form generation system from XML descrition files. 
         

=== Usage

The easiest way to test and use Rudder is to install it from the provided Linux packages, 
see: http://www.rudder-project.org/foswiki/Main/Installation

.For a more 'developper oriented' usage.

This project is managed thanks to Maven software project management (http://maven.apache.org/). 
You will have to have a working Maven (version 2.2.x or 3.0.x) installation.

.Clean, build and install on your local repository:
----
% mvn clean install
----

For now, the developpement environment is not trivial to set-up. We want to 
make it more easy so that an unique command will set-up the full environment, 
but we are afraid that until that bright future become true, you will have to
follow: http://www.rudder-project.org/foswiki/Development/SettingUpADevelopmentEnvironment
